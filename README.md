"I developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. The program employs object-oriented programming principles to create a modular and organized structure. The game features a simple console-based interface, allowing two players to take turns marking their respective symbols ('X' and 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The code includes logic to check for winning conditions, such as three consecutive symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, it ensures that players cannot make moves on already occupied positions. The program concludes with a clear display of the winner or a draw, providing an interactive and enjoyable experience for users."

SGML, or Standard Generalized Markup Language, is a standard for defining markup languages. It serves as a foundation for other markup languages like HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language). SGML itself doesn't include specific technologies but rather sets the standard for how markup languages should be defined and used.

However, when SGML is applied in the context of document markup, some technologies and tools that are commonly associated with it include:

DTD (Document Type Definition): DTD is a formal declaration of the document structure and attributes. It defines the rules and the legal elements of an SGML document. It is used to validate the structure and content of the document.

SGML Parser: An SGML parser is a software component that reads an SGML document, interprets the markup, and produces a structured representation of the document's content. It's a crucial component for processing SGML documents.

HyTime (Hypermedia/Time-based Structuring Language): HyTime is an SGML-based standard that extends SGML to include hypermedia and multimedia features. It provides a framework for linking and structuring information in a time-based context.

SGML Editors: Text editors or specialized SGML editors are used for creating and editing SGML documents. These editors often provide features to help authors adhere to the rules defined in the DTD.

SGML Open Catalogs: Catalogs are used to manage the resolution of public identifiers and system identifiers in SGML documents. They help in locating the necessary resources associated with the document.

ISO 8879 Standard: This is the official standard that defines SGML. It outlines the syntax and semantics of SGML, providing a framework for creating markup languages.

It's important to note that SGML is an older technology, and while it laid the groundwork for HTML and XML, these later markup languages have become more widely adopted for various applications on the web and beyond.
